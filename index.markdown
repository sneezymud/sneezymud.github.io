While SneezyMud  has changed hands a few times it currently runs on an Digital Ocean VPS cloud server paid for by current administration and supported by five "old guard" Immortals.  Currently we have 3 active developers, 3 builders and 1 site admin.

The code for the mud is written entirely in C++. We have several active coders and are looking to evolve the game and modernize the codebase. If you haven't played in a few years you'll probably find some cool new skills and abilities to play with.
